# Sales_Forecasting
Built a machine learning model using Python to predict future sales based on historical data. Used libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data preprocessing, model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest), and visualization. Helped identify sales trends and improved forecasting accuracy for better business decisions.
